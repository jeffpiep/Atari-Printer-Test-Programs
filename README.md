# Atari-Printer-Test-Programs
Here I have different Atari BASIC programs for testing printers. Some come from the field service manuals and others were written to test behavior. This repository originated from writing printer simulators for the [FujiNet project](https://github.com/FujiNetWIFI) and needing to validate their behavior.
